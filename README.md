# Job Preparation
 The repository contains solutions to various coding interview problems extracted from websites like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/neerazz90/), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/b_neerajkumarsi1), [Hackearth](https://www.hackerearth.com/@neerajkumarsingh), [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/dashboard#/), AlgoExpert & [EPI](https://github.com/neerazz/FAANG/blob/master/Algorithms/Resources/Elements%20of%20Programming%20Interviews%20in%20Java.pdf). I've tried to provide the detailed solution and the intution through comments. 
 
 These questions are classical problems that are most frequently asked by the tech giants in technical interviews and are not related to hard core competitive coding.
 `All the code provided inside the repository is purely original and completely my own.`

### How to contribute? 

1.  Fork the repository
2.  Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify)
3.  Make a pull request

### When to contribute?

1.  If there is no solution to a problem.
2.  If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch.
3.  If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size it would be better to, comment out the original solution and make a pull request with your solution.
