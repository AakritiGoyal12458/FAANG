Time Complexity: O(VE) where V is number of Vertices and E is the number of Edges.
Space Complexity: O(VE) where V is number of Vertices and E is the number of Edges.

1. First I have built a graph data structure using the provided number of nodes and the edges.
2. Then I traverse the graph using Breadth First Search for all the nodes, to get the unique number of nodes in that particular isolated graph.
3. Then do the mathematical formula on the returned count to compute the cost.
